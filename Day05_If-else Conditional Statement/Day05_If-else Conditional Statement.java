Given task about Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions: If  is odd, print Weird If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.
sample input (0)=3 //sample output= Weird //sample input (1)= 24 //sample output= Not Weird.

ðŸ“ŒDESCRIPTION:
Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b
You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

Java has the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
